Machine Learning
1...This repository contains a beginner-friendly implementation of linear regression from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of supervised learning by predicting housing prices based on house size.

Input data: House size (in 1000 square feet)
Target data: House price (in 1000s of dollars)
Model:Simple Linear Regression
 f(x)=w*x+b

 Features
Load and visualize training data (scatter plot).
Implement a linear model function to compute predictions.
Plot the predicted line vs. actual data.
Understand how model parameters affect predictions.

2...The second file contains about vectorization in 1-D and 2-D datas
Simple normal code that shows how vectorically we can achieve the result in far  more faster way so it is suitable or better to use the vectorizatin method.
